## 📊 **MATHEMATICAL SUPERIORITY:**

### **Coverage Analysis:**

```
6 AM Discovery Coverage:
  ✅ Covers: 6:00 AM - 11:59 PM (18 hours)
  ❌ Misses: 12:00 AM - 5:59 AM (6 hours = 25% of day)

12 AM Discovery Coverage:
  ✅ Covers: 12:00 AM - 11:59 PM (24 hours)
  ❌ Misses: 0 hours (0% of day)

IMPROVEMENT: 25% → 0% missed = 100% coverage gained!
```

### **Real-World Impact:**

```
Typical Daily Cricket Schedule:
  Early Morning: 6:00-11:00 AM (Test matches, overseas series)
  Afternoon: 12:00-5:00 PM (Domestic leagues)
  Evening: 6:00-11:00 PM (Prime time matches)

6 AM Miss Rate: ~15-30% of daily matches
12 AM Miss Rate: 0% of daily matches
```
